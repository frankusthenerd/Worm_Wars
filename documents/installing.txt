HOW TO INSTALL

Windows:

Run worm_wars.exe.

Compiling:

You will need a C++ compiler (like G++) and Allegro. Once you have that stuff installed
you can compile the game by moving into the source directory and running make. You should
get an executable. For other operating systems like Linux you may need to change the
makefile.
