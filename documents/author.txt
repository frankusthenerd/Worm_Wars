The concept of Worm Wars came, of course, from Nibbles or Snakes. Like these game the worms are
involved in eating something to grow. However, no fruits are eaten. Instead worms are pitted
against eachother and must eat the other completely in order to win. As a side note I wrote
Worm Wars in C++.
